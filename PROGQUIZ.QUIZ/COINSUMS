COIN SUMS
"""""""""



PROBLEM

In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence
(p). There are eight coins in general circulation:

    1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

    1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p

How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?



HISTORY

This is a common test at school for young children to get them used to
currency. The same test appears in the USA but with their denominations.
