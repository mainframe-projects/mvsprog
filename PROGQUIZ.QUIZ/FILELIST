                              GITHUB.COM REPO

For ease of administering this programming dataset I have created a
GITHUB repository at

        https://github.com/mvs38/mvsprog

where the latest additions can be found to this programming resource. This
also allows the option of cloning the repository and FTP'ing the files
into PDS members on your MVS machine or just using them from the web if
that is easier.



                              PROGQUIZ.AWS TAPE

Periodically I intend to release an AWS tape at this repository where
people can pull down the resource in an easy fashion.



                              PROGRAMMING QUIZ

The PROGQUIZ.doc dataset is a set of PDS members containing various
programming problems for the user to solve. Each file contains the
following:

1. A description of the problem 
2. Suggested approach or algorithm
3. Any References

It is suggested that the user creates a PDS for him/herself named
<USERNAME>.PROG.QUIZ.<LANGUAGE> with an appropriate member named after the
file that set the problem. This enables the user to tackle the problems
without interferance from other users.
