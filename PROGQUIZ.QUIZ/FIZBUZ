FIZZ BUZZ
"""""""""


PROBLEM

Write a program that counts up to a number (usually 100) and prints out
the number to the output device unless:

If the number is divisible by 3 replace the number with the word "fizz"

If the number is divisible by 5 replace the number with the word "buzz"

If the number is divisible by BOTH 3 and 5 replace the number with the
word "fizz buzz"


HISTORY

This comes from the kids game teaching them about division whilst trying
to keep track of an incrementing number
