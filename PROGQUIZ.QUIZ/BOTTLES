99 BOTTLES OF BEER 
""""""""""""""""""


PROBLEM

Write a program to create the lyrics of the old song "99 Bottles of Beer
on the Wall"

This problem is a very simple problem involving looping



NOTES

1. You should construct your program to use bottle and not bottles when
the count gets to 1 2. The last line of the last verse has a different
text resetting the wall.



LYRICS

99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.  
Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.  
Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.

 ....  ....

2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.  
Take one down and pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.

1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.  
Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.

No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.  
Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
