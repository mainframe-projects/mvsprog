GOLDBACH'S OTHER CONJECTURE
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""



PROBLEM

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number
can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square ( c = p + 2*n^2
). A composite number is a positive integer which is not prime (i.e.,
which has factors other than 1 and itself).

    9 = 7 + 2×12 15 = 7 + 2×22 21 = 3 + 2×32 25 = 7 + 2×32 27 = 19 +
    2×22 33 = 31 + 2×12

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of
a prime and twice a square?



ALGORITHM

A sample algorithm in Python:

    from IPython.display import Math, display
    from collections import defaultdict
    from itertools import count

    factors = defaultdict(list)
    witness = {}
    primes = set()
    for n in count(2):
        if factors[n]:
            # n is composite
            for m in factors.pop(n):
                factors[n+m].append(m)
            if n % 2:
                # n is odd and composite
                for k in range(1, int((n/2)**.5)+1):
                    p = n - 2*k**2
                    if p in primes:
                        # TODO: `in` is O(len(primes))
                        # could optimize by using set
                        witness[n] = k
                        break
                if not n in witness:
                    break
        else:
            factors[n*n].append(n)
            primes.add(n)

    lines = [r'{0} &= {1} + 2 \cdot {2}^2 \\'.format(n, n - 2*witness[n]**2, witness[n]) for n in sorted(witness)]
    Math(r"""
         \begin{{align}}
         {body}
         \end{{align}}
         """.format(body='\n'.join(lines[:100])))
