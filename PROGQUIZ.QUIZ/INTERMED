PROBLEMS

1. Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or
nothing between the numbers 1,2,…,9 (in this order) such that the
result is 100. For example 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 + 9 = 100.

2. Write a program that takes the duration of a year (in fractional days)
for an imaginary planet as an input and produces a leap-year rule that
minimizes the difference to the planet’s solar year.

3. Write a function that generates a DOT representation of a graph.

4. Write a program that automatically generates essays for you.

5. Write a program that automatically converts English text to Morse
code and vice versa.

6. Write a program that finds the longest palindromic substring of a
given string. Try to be as efficient as possible!

7. Implement a binary heap. Once using a list as the base data structure
and once by implementing a pointer-linked binary tree. Use it for
implementing heap-sort.

8. Implement an unbalanced binary search tree.

9 Implement a balanced binary search tree of your choice. I like
(a,b)-trees best.

10. Compare the performance of insertion, deletion and search on your
unbalanced search tree with your balanced search tree and a sorted
list. Think about good input sequences. If you implemented an (a,b)-tree,
think about good values of a and b.
