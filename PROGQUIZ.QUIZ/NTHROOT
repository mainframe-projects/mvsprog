NTH ROOT
""""""""



PROBLEM

Implement the algorithm to calculate the nth root of a positive real
number.


ALGORITHM

There is a very fast-converging nth root algorithm for finding the nth
root of A:

1. Make an initial guess x(0)

2. Set x(k+1) = 1/n  *  [ (n -1)  * x(k)  + A / x(k)(n-1)   ]
   In practice we do delta_x(k) = 1/n * [ A / x(k)^(n-1) - x(k)]
                     x(k+1) = x(k) + delta_x(k)

3. Repeat step 2 until desired precision is reached (ie | delta_x(k) | < e

A special case is the familiar square-root algorithm. By setting n = 2,
the iteration rule in step 2 becomes the square root iteration rule:

    x(k+1) = 1/2 * [ x(k) + A / x(k) ]
