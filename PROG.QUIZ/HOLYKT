HOLY KNIGHT
"""""""""""



PROBLEM

Chess coaches have been known to inflict a kind of torture on beginners by
taking a chess board, placing pennies on some squares and requiring that a
Knight's tour be constructed that avoids the squares with pennies.

This kind of knight's tour puzzle is similar to Hidato.

The present task is to produce a solution to such problems. At least
demonstrate your program by solving the following:

                _ 0 0 0 _ _ _ _
                _ 0 _ 0 0 _ _ _ 
                _ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                0 0 0 _ _ 0 _ 0
                0 _ 0 _ _ 0 0 0
                1 0 0 0 0 0 0 _
                _ _ 0 0 _ 0 _ _ 
                _ _ _ 0 0 0 _ _ 

Where 

    _       location of pennies
    1       starting position
    0       available squares
