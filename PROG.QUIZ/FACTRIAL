FACTORIAL CALCULATION
"""""""""""""""""""""



PROBLEM

Calculate the factorial of a given number.

The factorial of 0 (zero) is defined as being 1 (unity).

The Factorial Function of a positive integer, n is defined as the product of
the sequence: n,  n-1, n-2, ... 1

fact(n) = n* fact(n-1) ... 1

Write a function to return the factorial of a number.

Solutions can be iterative or recursive.  Support for trapping negative n 
(n < 0) errors is optional.
