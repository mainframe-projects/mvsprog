PENNEY'S GAME
"""""""""""""



PROBLEM
Penney's game is a game where two players bet on being the first to see a
particular sequence of heads or tails in consecutive tosses of a fair coin.

It is common to agree on a sequence length of three then one player will openly
choose a sequence, for example:

        Heads,  Tails,  Heads, or HTH for short.  
 
The other player on seeing the first players choice will choose his sequence.
The coin is tossed and the first player to see his sequence in the sequence of
coin tosses wins.


Example 

One player might choose the sequence HHT and the other THT.

Successive coin tosses of HTTHT gives the win to the second player as the last
three coin tosses are his sequence.


Task 

Create a program that tosses the coin, keeps score and plays Penney's game
against a human opponent.

- Who chooses and shows their sequence of three should be chosen randomly.  
- If going first, the computer should randomly choose its sequence of three.  
- If going second, the computer should automatically play the optimum sequence.
- Successive coin tosses should be shown.

Show output of a game where the computer chooses first and a game where the
user goes first here on this page.
