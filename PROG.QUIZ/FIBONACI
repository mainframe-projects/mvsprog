FIBONACCI SEQUENCE
""""""""""""""""""


HISTORY

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence,
called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two
preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

    F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1         and

    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)     for n > 1.

Fibonacci numbers are named after Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, later
known as Fibonacci. They appear to have first arisen as early as 200 BC in work
by Pingala on enumerating possible patterns of poetry formed from syllables of
two lengths. In his 1202 book Liber Abaci, Fibonacci introduced the sequence to
Western European mathematics, although the sequence had been described earlier
in Indian mathematics.

Fibonacci numbers appear unexpectedly often in mathematics, so much so that
there is an entire journal dedicated to their study, the Fibonacci Quarterly.
Applications of Fibonacci numbers include computer algorithms such as the
Fibonacci search technique and the Fibonacci heap data structure, and graphs
called Fibonacci cubes used for interconnecting parallel and distributed
systems.

They also appear in biological settings, such as branching in trees, the
arrangement of leaves on a stem, the fruit sprouts of a pineapple, the
flowering of an artichoke, an uncurling fern and the arrangement of a pine
cone's bracts.
