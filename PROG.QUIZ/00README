                              GITHUB.COM REPO 

For ease of administering this programming dataset I have created a GITHUB
repository at

        https://github.com/mvs38/mvsprog

where the latest additions can be found to this programming resource. This also
allows the option of cloning the repository and FTP'ing the files into PDS
members on your MVS machine or just using them from the web if that is easier.



                              PROGQUIZ.AWS TAPE 

Periodically I intend to release an AWS tape at this repository where people
can pull down the resource in an easy fashion.



                              PROGRAMMING QUIZ 

The PROG.QUIZ dataset is a set of PDS members containing various programming
problems for the user to solve. Each file contains the following:

1. A description of the problem 
2. Suggested approach or algorithm 
3. Any References

It is suggested that the user creates a PDS for him/herself named
<USERNAME>.PROG.QUIZ.<LANGUAGE> with an appropriate member named after the file
that set the problem. This enables the user to tackle the
