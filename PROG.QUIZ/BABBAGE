BABBAGE PROBLEM

PROBLEM

Charles Babbage, looking ahead to the sorts of problems his Analytical
Engine would be able to solve, gave this example:

What is the smallest positive integer whose square ends in the digits
269,696?
— Babbage, letter to Lord Bowden, 1837; see Hollingdale and Tootill,
Electronic Computers, second edition, 1970, p. 125.

Charles thought the answer might be 99,736, whose square is 9,947,269,696;
but he couldn't be certain.


The task is to find out if Babbage had the right answer — and to do so,
as far as your language allows it, in code that Babbage himself would
have been able to read and understand. As Babbage evidently solved the
task with pencil and paper, a similar efficient solution is preferred.

For these purposes, Charles Babbage may be taken to be an intelligent
person, familiar with mathematics and with the idea of a computer; he
has written the first drafts of simple computer programmes in tabular
form. [Babbage Archive Series L].
