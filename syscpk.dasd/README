Compiler/Language/Tools Volume Version 1.05 (2013/05/08)



The rationale for creating a single DASD volume with all of the
language compilers and related tools includes several factors:

easily install all compilers and related tools in a single step so
they are all ready to use, even if you might not initially realize
that an included tool will later be useful to you,

isolate compilers and related tools from the other MVS system
software,

when upgrades are necessary because new languages/tools have been
added, it is easier to copy down a new pack than to use a separate
install process, perhaps for several upgraded compilers or new tools.
(See Updating to a later version of SYSCPK below.)

In order to be compatible with the largest number of Hercules/MVS
users and also provide the maximum usable space, the type of DASD
volume chosen was a 3350.  The volume serial number is SYSCPK -
SYStem Compiler PacK.  The volume contains its own VSAM User Catalog:
UCSYSCPK and is installed with an ALIAS in the VSAM Master Catalog
of SYSC.  All Non-VSAM datasets on the volume begin with the high
level qualifier SYSC, so that they are automatically accessed via
the ALIAS/User Catalog relationship.  The volume also contains
a Procedure Library, in which all the procedures to access the
compilers/tools are cataloged.

As I created the volume and populated it with the compilers,
I attempted to include as much documentation as I could on the
volume itself.  You will find an index dataset - SYSC.$INDEX -
that contains a one line description of all the other datasets on
the volume.  I have also included $INDEX members in those datasets
where it was permissible to do so, and included one line descriptions
of the contents of the individual members of the datasets.

The dataset SYSC.SETUP.CNTL contains two jobstreams which will assist
in the incorporation of the volume into your existing MVS system.
It also contains the jobstreams I used to initially set up the
volume - initializing the volume, building the User Catalog/ALIAS,
and allocating the Partitioned Datasets for the Procedure Library
and Load Library.

All other datasets on the volume were created during the process of
installing the compilers/tools listed on the prior page of this site.
There were some modifications made to the target library names in
order to fit the target environment, but the same basic installation
jobs were used.  A major difference is that, whenever possible, I
installed from source code instead of reloading object libraries and
I have left the source code intact in datasets on the SYSCPK volume.



Installation / Integration The tasks necessary to install the volume
into an existing Hercules/MVS system are:

Download the archive containing the volume and unpack it in the
directory where your other DASD volume images reside;

With Hercules/MVS running, attach the volume to Hercules and vary
it online to MVS;

Run the job to Import/Connect the User Catalog;

Run the job to modify the JES2 procedure and the SYS1.PARMLIB
members;

Shutdown MVS/Hercules;

Add the volume to your Hercules' configuration file;

Restart Hercules/MVS.



1. Download the archive and unpack the volume.  SYSCPK.tar.gz [15.3
mb MD5: b01fca5b587651b7b1d209d6785dd8fd] contains a single file,
the 3350 DASD volume image.  Unpack it and place it in the same
directory with your other DASD volume images.  As provided, the
volume is not compressed, but you can compress it using the dasdcopy
utility included with Hercules by using the command:

dasdcopy -z -a syscpk.3350 ofile

where ofile is the name of the file to contain the compressed DASD
image.  You will probably wish to rename the image file in order
to be consistent with the naming scheme for DASD volumes in your
environment, so it would be appropriate to rename the volume image
at the same time you are compressing it.  If you do not utilize
compressed DASD on your system, you may simply rename the volume
image after it has been unpacked so that the name is consistent
with your other volumes.

A Volume Table of Contents listing of the SYSCPK volume may be seen
at:  SYSCPK Volume Table of Contents Listing.

2. Attach the volume and place it online to MVS.  Because MVS will
default to PUBLIC class for volumes auto-mounted at IPL, it is
preferable to start Hercules and MVS without adding a reference to
the SYSCPK volume to your Hercules' configuration file at this time.

Let me restate that this is a 3350 DASD image, so you will need to
determine an appropriate address in your MVS system to which the
volume may be mounted.

Use the Hercules' attach command to open the volume image to
Hercules:



Use the Vary and Mount commands on the MVS console to place the
volume online:



The above example is from a system built using my instructions,
so address 257 is defined as a 3350 device. This may not be true
on your system!



3. Run the job to Import/Connect the User Catalog.  As mentioned
above, there are jobstreams included in the dataset SYSC.SETUP.CNTL
on the volume that will integrate the volume into your existing
MVS system.  The first of these to be run is in the member IMPORT.
This jobstream uses IDCAMS to connect the User Catalog on the SYSCPK
volume to the VSAM Master Catalog and then defines an ALIAS so
that the high level qualifier SYSC is related to the User Catalog.
The contents of that jobstream are:

//IMPORT JOB (SYS),'IMPORT USER
CAT',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=A, // MSGLEVEL=(1,1) //* //*
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* //* * //* On the DASD volume SYSCPK there is a User Catalog
defined. All * //* of the datasets contained on that volume are
catalogued in that * //* User Catalog. This job IMPORTS that
User Catalog into the MVS * //* Master Catalog, thereby making
the User Catalog and its contents * //* visable to MVS. An Alias
is then defined in the Master Catalog * //* that will direct
all searches for datasets beginning with the * //* High Level
Qualifier "SYSC" to be directed to the User Catalog on * //* the
SYSCPK volume. Any new datasets created with a High Level * //*
Qualifier of "SYSC" will be cataloged in that User Catalog. * //* *
//* -----------------------------------------------------------------
* //* //IDCAMS01 EXEC PGM=IDCAMS,REGION=4096K //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSCPK DD UNIT=3350,DISP=OLD,VOL=SER=SYSCPK //SYSIN DD *

  IMPORT CONNECT OBJECTS ( - UCSYSCPK - DEVICETYPE (3350) - VOLUMES
  (SYSCPK) )

  DEFINE ALIAS ( - NAME (SYSC) - RELATE (UCSYSCPK) )

// Submit the job; the single step should receive a return code
of 0000.  If your Master Catalog is password protected, you will
be prompted on the MVS Operator's console for the password twice
during the execution of this job - once when the User Catalog is
imported and again when the Alias is created.



4. Run the job to modify the JES2 procedure and the SYS1.PARMLIB
members.  The catalogued procedure used to start JES2, which is
contained in SYS1.PROCLIB,  must be modified in order to search
the Procedure Library on the SYSCPK volume.  Also, two members of
SYS1.PARMLIB must be updated - IEAAPF??, which controls from which
load libraries authorized programs may be executed, and VATLST??,
which determines the Class under which DASD volumes are automatically
mounted during IPL.  I have written a program and a jobstream to
execute the program which reads the existing contents of the members
to be changed and generates a second jobstream to apply the changes.
The generated jobstream may be edited before it is submitted, or
submitted directly to the internal reader.  The source of the program
is contained in SYSC.SETUP.CNTL(ISYSCPK); it has been compiled and
the load module is contained in SYSC.LINKLIB, ready to execute.
The jobstream to execute is contained in SYSC.SETUP.CNTL(ISYSCPKJ):

//ISYSCPK JOB (SYS),'INTEGRATE SYSCPK',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=X // EXEC
PGM=ISYSCPK,REGION=1024K //STEPLIB  DD DSN=SYSC.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR
//SYSOUT   DD SYSOUT=* //SYSUT1   DD DUMMY                  <-

TO CHECK GENERATED JOB //*SYSUT2   DD  SYSOUT=(A,INTRDR)    <-
USE TO SUBMIT GENERATED JOB // You may submit it as it exists
to produce a listing of the jobstream that will be generated.
The SYSOUT DD will contain a progress log:

JOBSTREAM ISYSCPK: EXECUTION CONCLUDES The actual member names for
IEAAPF?? and VATLST?? may vary widely among systems; each name
includes a two character suffix that is either specified in the
IEASYS00 member of SYS1.PARMLIB or defaults to 00 if not specified.
The generated jobstream will first copy the existing contents of
the members to be modified, creating backups:

SYS1.PROCLIB(JES2) is backed up in SYS1.PROCLIB(JES2OLD)
SYS1.PARMLIB(IEAAPF??) is backed up in SYS1.PARMLIB(IEAAPF99)
SYS1.PARMLIB(VATLST??) is backed up in SYS1.PARMLIB(VATLST99)

so they may be restored in case of major problems.  If the JES2
procedure becomes damaged so that JES2 will not start, the previous
procedure may be used by substituting JES2OLD for JES2 in the
start command:

S JES2OLD

Submit the job; the single step of the job should receive a return
code of 0000.

Note:  The JES2 startup procedure will be modified to place the
Procedure Library on SYSCPK - SYSC.PROCLIB - as the first library
in the concatenation for PROC00.  For personal preference, you may
wish to modify the JES2 procedure to place SYSC.PROCLIB in another
position in the concatenation.  This is discussed a bit more in
the section below - Executing the Compilers/Tools.



5. Shutdown MVS/Hercules.  Shut down MVS and then Hercules.



6. Add the volume to your Hercules' configuration file.  Edit the
Hercules' configuration file used when Hercules is executed to
run MVS (probably mvs.cnf, or turnkey_mvs.conf located in the conf
subdirectory if you are running a version of the Turnkey system).
You do not have to add the volume attached to the same address you
used when you manually attached it above (in step 2), but be sure
that the address you use has been generated as a 3350 DASD device.

I do not run my system with any DASD volumes set to readonly, but I
received feedback that if you set SYSCPK as readonly on the Turnkey
system, you cannot access any members of any Partitioned Dataset
on SYSCPK.  If you are concerned about accidentally updating the
SYSCPK volume image, you can use the fakewrite option, which will
accept write operations to the volume image and report them as
completed to MVS, but will not actually perform the write to the
volume image file.



7. Restart Hercules/MVS.  Restart Hercules and MVS normally.
All of the compilers/tools on the SYSCPK volume are now usable in
your system.



Executing the Compilers/Tools With very few exceptions, all of
the load modules in SYSC.LINKLIB are executed using catalogued
procedures, which are located in the Procedure Library on SYSCPK -
SYSC.PROCLIB.  Each of the procedures contains a STEPLIB DD card so
that the system will search SYSC.LINKLIB for the load module rather
than using any of the libraries named in the Linklist.  The necessity
for a STEPLIB rather than relying on the Linklist is that any library
to be included in the Linklist must be catalogued in the Master
Catalog, and part of the design was to have a completely contained
volume with all of its objects catalogued in its own User Catalog.

in this library will be located first, because the modification of
the JES2 procedure places the DD statement for this library first
in the concatenation.  If for any reason you still want to execute a
similar procedure from the other library(s), you will need to modify
the JES2 procedure to allow procedure library specification in JCL.
That is not difficult to do and is described at:  How can I execute
catalogued procedures from a library other than SYS1.PROCLIB?



Updating to a later version of SYSCPK Yes, I expect to continue to
add compilers and related tools to the Language Compilers Available
for MVS 3.8 page, and I will now be adding them to the SYSCPK image,
at the same time.  Whenever I make an addition, I will place an entry
on Changes and update the version number and date in the heading of
this page.  If you want to update your copy of the SYSCPK volume
image to the latest version, all you need to do is download the
archive, extract the image, and (with Hercules/MVS not running,
of course), use it to replace the previous version of the volume
image pointed to in your Hercules' configuration file.

I have also added a SYSC.$HISTORY dataset on the volume to track
updates to the volume's contents.  The entries in this dataset for
the most recent updates are:

VV.MM __ Date __
_____________________________________________________ 01.13
2019/07/29  1, Update Ed Liss' BASIC360 to V3.1.0 Of course, in
order to prevent this type of update from impacting your system,
you must not modify or add to the contents of the SYSCPK volume.
If you do make modifications, you will need to maintain your own
system to re-apply those modifications following an update of the
volume image from this site.  It is not an impossible task, but is
probably one best avoided.

I would especially elicit feedback if you have installed SYSCPK
on your system and encountered any problems or see areas where
clarification would be helpful.  This was a major task that has
taken me several weeks of effort to complete.  It is certainly
possible that there are minor problems that I have managed to miss,
in spite of quite a bit of testing.  I would be grateful for the
notification of any problems or difficulties you encounter.  Also,
I believe that I have contemplated all possible issues in the design
of the ISYSCPK program, but I do not have access to more than a
few configurations of Hercules/MVS to test on and most of them are
really quite similar.  So if you have a particular configuration
that causes unexpected behavior of ISYSCPK, please let me know.

I hope that you have found my instructions useful.  If you have
questions that I can answer to help expand upon the information I
have included here, please don't hesitate to send them to me:
